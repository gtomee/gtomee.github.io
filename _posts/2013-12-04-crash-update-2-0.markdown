Hello world!

<strong>TL;DR </strong>: <span class="big"> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gtomee.crash"> PLAY HERE</a> </span>

It has been a long time, but we have fresh news!

The code for Crash needed to be cleaned and refactored, so we spent some time doing this first to have a proper code base.

And then we decided to add some new features, simple but still fun: a new <strong> leaderboard </strong>, the <strong> achievements </strong> and a nice <strong> music </strong>.

<strong> Many thanks to Benjamin Bouvier </strong> for the awesome track, called "Crash in C Minor". Now the immersion has reached the next level!

Regarding the new leaderboard and the achievements, we decided to drop our homemade solution and use the Google Game Services instead. Yes you need to sign in with your Google+ account but you have the control of what you want to share and show publicly. Moreover it's also a better solution for us because we saved a lot of time by not redoing yet another highscores system.

The game is available for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gtomee.crash"> Google Play </a>.

Hope you'll enjoy it!

See you in space!
