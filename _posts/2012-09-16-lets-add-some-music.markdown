Hello,

<a href="/img/old/music.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-391 aligncenter" title="Eat That Snow Music button" src="/img/old/music.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a>

If you've played Eat That Snow, you may have been a little annoyed by all of the creepy sounds (boiiiiing!), and as far as you've been playing you may have told yourself : "I feel like I miss something but I don't know what ..."

You're right, there wasn't any music. And to be honest it looked a bit sad !

But it is now over, thanks to <strong>Benjamin Bouvier</strong> who just composed a very nice track called <strong>Beat Dat</strong> <strong>Snow</strong> !

So now you can entirely rediscover the game with a new music environment!
We hope you'll have a lot of fun and will enjoy a new experience of Eat That Snow. Here are the links to play the two versions of the game:

	<li><a href="http://eatthatsnow.gtomee.com">http://eatthatsnow.gtomee.com</a> (HTML5)</li>
</ul>
Many thanks to Benjamin for his contribution !
