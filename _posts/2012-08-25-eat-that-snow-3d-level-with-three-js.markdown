Hi,

Have you ever wondered how do Eat That Snow levels look like in <strong>3D</strong> ?

Here is a lab showing the level 4 from our game <strong>Eat That Snow</strong> (<a title="Eat That Snow on Android" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gtomee.eatthatsnow">Android</a> and <a title="Eat That Snow HTML5" href="http://eatthatsnow.gtomee.com/">HTML5</a>), in 3D !
It is created in Javascript with <em>Three.js</em>, so you need aÂ WebGL compatible browser (latest Firefox and Chrome for instance) to see the demo :

Here is a screenshot :

Code is on <a href="https://github.com/gtomee/EatThatSnow-3D-levels">github</a>.

There may be some improvements in the future, we will probably add clouds, snowflakes and background mountains :)
