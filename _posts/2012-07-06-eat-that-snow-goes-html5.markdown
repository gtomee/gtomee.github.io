Hi !

We are very pleased to release the HTML5 version of Eat That Snow !
It means you can now use your browser to play the game ! Just follow the link bellow to start jumping and eating some snow :)

<a title="eatthatsnow.gtomee.com" href="http://eatthatsnow.gtomee.com" target="_blank">eatthatsnow.gtomee.com</a>

The games requires WebGL, so you need at least one of the latest release of Chrome, Firefox or Opera, or Internet Explorer 9+.

We hope you'll have a lot of fun.

See you very soon for some hot new stuff !
