Hi,

Here at Gtomee we have two identities like superheroes : a real identity, students in a famous French university, and a secret identity, developers at Gtomee !

But right now, we are on "vacation", which means no classes during the day. But like superheroes, we are not going to rest ! Be aware that we are working hard on a nice feature for Crash... But we may also have some secret plans to offer you more fun before 2012...<a href="http://gtomee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/christmas-present.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94" title="christmas-present" src="http://gtomee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/christmas-present-300x300.jpg" alt="A Chistmas present" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Be ready to download your Christmas presents !

Jérémy and Thibaut
