Hello,

As we told you in the previous little speech, we are very pleased to introduce new hot stuff.
We have been thinking about new ideas for some time, but we didn't really know how to put them in new games. For most of them, there are just small challenges or something we want to test.

So we decided to create a brand new place : the <strong>Labs</strong>Â .

<a href="http://gtomee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gtomee_labs.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-301 aligncenter" title="gtomee_labs" src="http://gtomee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gtomee_labs-300x120.png" alt="" width="300" height="120" /></a>

In these labs, there will be experiments, tests, tutorials and even mini-games !
We will be speaking about technologies we like and use, for instance the libgdx game engine or HTML5/JS.

We hope you will enjoy and that it may be useful for you !
